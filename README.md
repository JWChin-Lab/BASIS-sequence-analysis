# BASIS-sequence-analysis
This repository contains relevant codes to verify sequences of BASIS assemblies. The analysis workflow specifically requires next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of input episomes (input BACs) used for the assembly and compares input BAC sequences with the final assembly, calling variants that might have accumulated during assembly procedure.

To perform analysis, follow commented versions of .rmd files.
